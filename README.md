# SkyLaunch
SkyLaunch is the launcher built by Blocked Sky Hypixel guild, but for the entire MC community.
Made with Python 3 by CactusBlue (or Randomness, or whatever you prefer to call me)

# Features
* Highly modular, ease of editing - It can be easily edited with Python.
* Lots of documentation: An in-depth explanation of everything in the wiki!
* Easy to deploy - good for server admins/modpack makers
* Open source - driven by the community!

# To Do
* Actually launching Minecraft. It's coming along quite well, I need to say.
* Pretty much anything. This is FAR from complete.

# Build Guide
Coming soon. I don't know how to do it myself either. :P
